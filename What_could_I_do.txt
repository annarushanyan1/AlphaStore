What could I do but didn't do because of the short time.

***** Creating admin

     Admin who would be able to see some graphics, users list,would be able to answer to users' questions.

***** Creating more columns for the table products(SQL)
     
     For exalmple, name, brand, description, size, colors, etc.. and use it in searching

***** VALIDATION

     Validation for registration

***** Buy List

     When the user selects items from cart to buy after buying the information is going to DB.
     So I could make some place in the client side where user could see the products which he/she has bought

***** night and light mode
     One Button in the header of the application which is change mode, from night and light and opposite.
